# 📸 Picture to Story

Picture to Story is a **Generative Artificial Intelligence pipeline** that converts images into short, creative stories.  
It first generates a caption from a photo and then transforms it into a rich narrative — adding a unique twist to your images.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python:** Main programming language for developing this pipeline.
- **Generative AI:** Hugging Face transformers for caption and story generation.
- **Pillow:** To handle and process images.

## 🚀 How it works
Picture to Story performs 2 main tasks:

1️⃣ **Caption Generation:**  
   It converts the photo into a short caption that summarizes its content.

2️⃣ **Story Generation:**  
   It then uses this caption as a prompt to generate a creative short story — adding imagination and context to your photo.
